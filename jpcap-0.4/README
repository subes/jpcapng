*Introduction

Jpcap is a Java package for LBL libpcap (Packet Capture Library) and
Raw Socket API. 


*Requirements:

  - Java 2 Runtime Environment or SDK (http://java.sun.com)
  - libpcap (http://ee.lbl.gov/ or http://www.tcpdump.org)
    OR
  - WinPcap for Windows (http://winpcap.polito.it/)

* Compile

On UNIX:
# I'm sorry but I have to say that I'm not an expert UNIX C programmer,
# so I cannot make a good Makefile...

Go to "src/c". Then, edit Makefile.
There are several options you have to change
according to the type of the OS you're installing to.

Also you might have to modify Jpcap_sub.h to enable IPv6 feature.
However, you need header files for v6 installed in your OS.

Run make to generate libjpcap.so.
(If you get an error "structure has no member name sa_len...",
please comment out the line "#define HAVE_SA_LEN" in Jpcap_sub.h.
I'm so sorry for inconvenience.)


On Windows:
I included the project file of Visual C++, yet I'm not sure
if it works under different environment. It is under "src/c/Proj".
You can open the project file, and compile the source files to generate
Jpcap.dll.


*Installation

On UNIX:
1) Copy libjpcap.so to [Java directory]/jre/lib/<arch>.
   <arch> is either "i386" or "sparc" 
OR
1') Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the path where libjpcap.so exists.

2) Copy jpcap.jar to extension directory (eg./usr/local/java/jre/lib/ext)
OR
2') Set CLASSPATH to include jpcap.jar.

On Windows:
1) Copy "lib\Jpcap.dll" into "[JRE directory]\bin" or
   "[JRE directory]\lib\ext\x86"
2) Copy "lib\jpcap.jar" into "[JRE directory]\lib\ext"
3) If you installed J2SE SDK, you also need to copy "lib\jpcap.jar" into
"[SDK directory]\jre\lib\ext". 

Note: [JRE directory] is usually "C:\Program Files\Java\j2re*".
      [SDK directory] is usually "C:\j2sdk*".


*Usage

See the documentations under the directory 'doc'.
You can also check some example source codes under 'sample'

*Note

Some Linux distributions, such as RedHat, have their original
libpcap. Jpcap doesn't work with them. I don't know why...
In that case, please download libpcap from www.tcpdump.org
and install it instead of pre-installed one.
