Jpcap ver.0.03

*Introduction

Jpcap is a Java package for LBL libpcap (Packet Capture Library) and
Raw Socket API. 


*Installation

Requirements:

  - JDK1.1 or higher (http://java.sun.com)
  - libpcap (http://ee.lbl.gov/ or http://www.tcpdump.org)
    OR
  - WinPcap for Windows (http://netgroup-serv.polito.it/winpcap/)

Compile:

I'm sorry but I have to say that I'm not an expert UNIX C programmer,
so I can only make a poor Makefile...

First, download jpcap.tar.gz or jpcap.zip and decompress it.

Then, edit Makefile. There are several options you have to change
according to what OS you're installing to.

Also you might have to modify Jpcap_sub.h to enable IPv6 feature.
However, you need header files for v6 installed in your machine.

Run make.
(If you get an error "structure has no member name sa_len...",
please comment out the line "#define HAVE_SA_LEN" in Jpcap_sub.h.
I'm so sorry for inconvenience.)


Copy libjpcap.so to JDK lib directory (eg./usr/local/java/i386/green_threads
   or /usr/local/java/jre/lib/sparc),
 OR
   Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the path where libjpcap.so exists.

Copy jpcap.jar to extension directory (eg./usr/local/java/jre/lib/ext) if
   you're using JDK1.2 or higher.
 OR
   Set CLASSPATH to include jpcap.jar.


Compiling on Windows:
I included the project file of Visual C++, yet I'm not sure
if it works under different environment. In order to compile,
you need WinPcap Developer's Pack and the source of WinDump.
Both are downloadable from http://netgroup-serv.poolito.it./winpcap/

I also included the compiled .DLL file. If you don't want to compile,
just place jpcap.dll in the same dir with the application that uses
Jpcap, or copy it to system directory.


*Usage

See the documentations under the directory 'doc-??'.


*Note

Some Linux distributions, such as RedHat, have their original
libpcap. Jpcap doesn't work with them. I don't know why...
In that case, please download libpcap from www.tcpdump.org
and install it instead of pre-installed one.
